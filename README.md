## How It's Made: 

Tech used: HTML, CSS

Tech Skills Inc Clone Site- I developed a fully responsive login page for TechSkills Inc., showcasing my expertise in front-end development
and design. The login page provides users with a sleek and intuitive interface to access their accounts securely. The login form features clear labels 
and input fields for email/username and password, enhancing usability and accessibility for all users.The login page includes interactive buttons for signing in 
and creating an account, with hover effects and transitions to provide feedback to users.
